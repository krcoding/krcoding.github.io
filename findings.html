											<h3>What did I learn about Narrative?</h3>
											<p>I learned that not only does all media that humans consume have a narrative, but also, the structure and format of the narrative can greatly change the effect on the person reading (or in this case, playing) it. Along with that, the commonality of narrative--that is, the idea that it emulates our lives, and gives our lives meaning--was especially evident in games like <i>Analogue: A Hate Story</i>, which is a game full of vignettes and the diaries of people who died millions of years ago, whose anecdotes and adventures make you grow to care about them. It's really a testament to fiction, that I can empathize with someone who isn't even real.</p>

											<h3>About Genre?</h3>
											<p>I learned that genre also had an impact on the games I examined, but interestingly enough, the games I chose not only defied genre expectations, but also were a bizarre mish-mash of other genres as well.</p>

												<h2>Findings</h2>
												<p>At least, what I have right now--after all, this IS is a work in progress!</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/analogue_game_cap.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p><center><i>An example of a log file in the game <b>Analogue: A Hate Story.</b> <a href="http://ahatestory.com/">(Source: Analogue: A Hate Story Official Website.)</a></i></center></p>

											<p>Well, I found out a lot over the course of this IS. I not only found out more about my own conceptions of genre and narrative, but also, I learned more about video games, anime and manga as a whole as well. All in all, I'm glad I was given the chance to do this research in an academic setting!</p>

											<h3>So, what did you find?</h3>
											<p>As mentioned earlier, I learned about the basics not only of genres such as romance, tragedy, horror, and comedy, but also I learned about how those genres effect our preconceived notions of how the works we consume should "work".</p>

											<p>Since visual novels are primarily Japanese, and I am a Comparative Literature major, it was really interesting to see how the genre was effected both by Western and Japanese thought. Some examples of this that are more obvious include the <b>clear influence of anime,</b> especially in regards to different subgenres of visual novels.</p>

											<p>For example, many <b>otome</b> games, such as <i>Hatoful Boyfriend</i> and <i>Hakuouki</i>, are based on shoujo anime tropes, especially in regards to their romantic routes, all of which feature <b>bishounen</b> (美少年)... Or, in other words, <i>pretty boys.</i> (Yes, that is the literal translation of the word. <u>Beautiful.</u>) That aside, these notions of genre and narrative also informed the game's presentation, with the game playing into anime tropes, and even subverting a few.</p>


											<h3>What's up with the main games you chose?</h3>
											<h2>Danganronpa</h2>
											<p><i>Danganronpa 2</i>, while being a murder mystery adventure visual novel, also fell into plenty of anime tropes, and even has a romantic section that follows a similar format to the aforementioned otome games! Akin to an anime <i>Hunger Games</i>, the franchise follows groups of prodigies from a school for prodigies as they are forced to compete in a killing game involving getting away with murder scot-free. As you can guess, this goes well for... Well, precisely <i>no one.</i> (Besides the Mastermind, of course.)</p>
												<p>To escape where they are trapped, the students are only allowed to leave if they murder one another and get away with it scot-free after an investigation and <b>Class Trial</b>, and if the students choose the wrong killer, then they all die. But, if the killer is chosen, then they are executed. WIth stakes high, players have to figure out not only who's the mastermind, but what the <i>heck</i> is happening behind-the-scenes of this gruesome game.</p>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/dr_game_cap.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p><center><i>An example of Class Trial gameplay in the game "Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc". (The first game in the "Danganronpa" franchise.)<a href="http://www.everybodyplays.co.uk/review/Danganronpa-Trigger-Happy-Havoc-review/1632">(Image Credit: Everybody Plays)</a></i></center></p>

											<p>Also, the second <i>Danganronpa</i> game (which is the one I am specifically examining) has a plot that not only subverts genre expectations, but also breaks the fourth wall to critique video games and the narrative structure of video games as a whole in-plot, to an important effect. (Don't worry, no spoilers here! But, there will be spoilers in my IS, so. Be warned.)</p>

												<p>So, it is interesting to see how that plays out in different visual novels, as it seems to be a common theme in all of them. Its visual presentation is a postmodern, 3D-and-2.5D anime cacophany, and its narrative riffs on popular anime, murder mystery, and suspense tropes to create a memorable experience.</p>

												<h2>Analogue: A Hate Story</h2>
											<p><i>Analogue: A Hate Story,</i> an American visual novel very much inspired by the "normal" visual novel format (romantic routes included), is a story about a historian who talks to the AIs on an abandoned Korean colonization ship after a tragedy killed everyone on board, and soon learns about the people's lives on the ship, immortalized by their diary logs.</p>

											<p><i>Analogue,</i> also, like <i>Danganronpa</i>, is an intersting mix of genres. A game by an American developer about a Korean colonization ship, this game has an interesting format, interesting visual presentation (meant to mirror a computer desktop and command line), and really immerses players in the fictional investigation of what happened to be passengers of the colonization space ship, the <i>Mugunghwa.</i> With investigation, puzzle, and even romantic elements, this game also stood as an intersting intersection of genre and format, proving that video games and visual novels can be a powerful form of narrative if used well.</p>

											<p><i>Analogue</i> also eschews the usual visual novel format in lieu of a more open-ended and alternative story format, allowing for plenty of exploration and discussion of topics that one would normally not consider in a video game, such as Korean history, the oppression of women, and also discussions of morality and sexuality. (Plus, it also has an entire puzzle based on command lines, so hey, nerd points for that one.) With dialogue that changes drastically whether or not your character is male or female, and with two AIs with gray morality, this game is an interesting subversion of visual novel, anime, and sci-fi tropes.</p>

											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
											<p>So, all in all, I found that these games, both similar and alike, share many of the same characteristics. Even with their anime art and their tropes, their layout and their genre cliches, I found that not only are Visual Novels a wonderful mode for expressing narrative or a story, but also learned to appreciate them much more for what they are: A unique experience.</p>

											<h3>What did you learn about anime and manga, and their impact on visual novels?</h3>
											<p>I learned that they had a <b>huge</b> impact on visual novels, even the American ones. I also learned about their genre expectations and tropes as well, and how they intersected with Western thought about genre. All in all, it was really interesting, seeing how they all relate!</p>
